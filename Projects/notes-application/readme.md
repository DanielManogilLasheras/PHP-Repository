* This project is an note application that will allow the user to navigate through a series of pages, in which the user will be able to:
  - Write and save notes inside a SQL database.
  - Perform updates, deletes and retrieval of notes.
  - See the list of notes in the home page.

* The objective of the project is to push my knowledge and understanding of the PHP language that I'm studying in my vocational training's second year, and to learn from the common mistakes, problems and other complexities that can rise during the process of coding.

* Up to now, I have been able to perform:
  - I have investigated about the several ways to create a PHP project and I have made a project through composer.
  - I have successfully created the Database class in order to stablish a connection with the apache local server.
  - I have successfully create the Note class and it's save method, that allows me to create a note object and through inheritance, and use the connection method to       store the object inside the database through the save method.
  - I have successfully created a basic form and form validation with some basic css to allow the user to create notes.

  * For the moment I will place the project in standby and I will focus my activities on learning more about PHP and complete other minor exercises in other to           practice, get a better understanding of the PDO and POO in PHP and acquire better practices to have an effective, clean and secure code.
